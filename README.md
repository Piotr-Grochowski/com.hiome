# Hiome

This app adds Hiome occupancy & door sensors support for Homey.

Unlock the full power of your smart home!

Adds support for Hiome.com occupancy & door sensors.
Hiome Door is a small sensor for your door, a giant leap for your home. 
It knows exactly how many people are in each room, even if you haven't moved for hours. 
Your lights stay on while you're in the room, and immediately turn off when you leave. 
No more waving your arms around in the dark.

NOTICE: if you updated to 2.0 or above from previous versions, it's required to recreate all the devices as Hiome MQTT API changed.

Features:
- discovery of occupancy, door sensors & battery packs connected to Hiome Core
- occupancy sensor support (indicates that a room is occupied and the number of persons in a room)
- door sensor support (indication if a door is opened or closed)
- flow support (triggers a flow when the number of people in a room changed or a room becomes (un-)occupied)
- battery pack support (battery level reporting for connected door sensor)
- battery pack charger support (connect charging cable to a battery pack and Homey will be able to discover a new Battery pack device and show charging progress)
- ability to change the number of people in a room from Homey (Hiome Core error compensation)
- support for Hiome Core in a different than standard (hiome.local) location
- two Hiome Cores support (for larger installations)
- additional sensor informations (like version number)
- device avaibility status based on the heartbeat

Practical informations on error compensation:
- You can use maintenance actions to increment/decrement/reset occupancy in a room
- You can use application configuration page to increment/decrement occupancy in multiple rooms
- You can also increment/decrement/reset/set number of persons from a flow
- If you have any motion sensors in a room you can make a flow which triggers on motion, checks if in that room the number of people is >0. If not - increase (movement means that somebody is inside).

Additional informations regarding battery reporting
- If battery is connected, then battery alarm and battery level are reported
- If battery is not connected, but you use power outlet - battery level is reported as unknown and battery alarm always as OK
- Sensor measures battery pack voltage (3,3V - 4,2V). So Homey calculates battery level depending on the voltage value. But decrease in voltage is not linear. It will drop quickly from 4.2V to 3.6V and will stay at this level for most of battery life as this is nominal voltage of the battery pack. Then it will drop down. So most of the time battery level will be reported as around 30%. 
- Battery alarm is fired when the voltage goes below 3.5V. It gives you a few days to recharge battery pack.
